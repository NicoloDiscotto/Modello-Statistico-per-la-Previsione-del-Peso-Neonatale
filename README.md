Inferential Statistical Model for Predicting Neonatal Weight for Profession.AI

This project presents an inferential statistical model developed to predict neonatal birth weight using regression techniques applied to a simulated clinical dataset. 
The analysis, conducted in R Markdown for Profession.AI, includes the following phases:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Development of multiple regression models
- Evaluation of models using statistical tests such as ANOVA, BIC and VIF
- Residual analysis to assess assumptions of homoscedasticity, normality and absence of outliers
- Selection of the optimal model based on statistical significance and interpretability
